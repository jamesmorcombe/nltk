I don't know where or how to report bugs so...
I have python3.4 on wiindows 8
I tried to download nltk-3.0a3.win32.exe
I received an error message when I tried to install...
"could not create key - nltk-py3.4"

followed by
"could not set key value python 3.4 nltk-3.0a3"

The install hasn't worked as an import of nltk produces
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>
    import nltk
  File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\nltk\__init__.py", line 111, in <module>
